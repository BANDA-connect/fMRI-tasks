Ventral Striatum Reactivity (Reward)

Following Delgado et al., 2000 (Tracking the hemodynamic responses to reward and punishment in the striatum. in Barch et al 2013 from the HCP 
* Blocked-design-number guessing paradigm
o Participants play a card guessing game where they are asked to guess the number on a mystery card (represented by a ???) in order to win or lose money.
o They are told that potential card numbers range from 1?9 and to indicate if they think the mystery card number is more or less than 5 by pressing one of two buttons on the response box. 
o Feedback is the number on the card (generated by the program as a function of whether the trial was a reward, loss or neutral trial) and either: 
* 1) a green up arrow with ?$1? for reward trials, 
* 2) a red down arrow next to ?$0.50 for loss trials; or 
* 3) the number 5 and a gray double headed arrow for neutral trials. 

o Trial sequence:
* The ??? is presented for up to 1.5 s (if the participant responds before 1.5s, a fixation cross is displayed for the remaining time) 
* following by feedback for 1.0 s. 
* There is a 1.0 s ITI with a ?+? presented on the screen. 
o The task is presented in blocks of 8 trials that are either mostly:
* reward (6 reward trials pseudo randomly interleaved with either 1 neutral and 1 loss trial, 2 neutral trials, or 2 loss trials) or
* mostly loss (6 loss trials interleaved with either 1 neutral and 1 reward trial, 2 neutral trials, or 2 reward trials). 
* In each of the two runs, there are 2 mostly reward and 2 mostly loss blocks, interleaved with 4 fixation blocks (15 s each). 
o All participants are provided with money as a result of completing the task, though it is a standard amount across subjects.
o Each reward/loss Block is 28 sec
o fixation blocks 15 s each
o Run length 2 min 52 sec
o Total 5 min 44 seg
o Al subject data is stored in the data folder
Reward_get_conditions.py is the script to get the onsets and duration of blocks
